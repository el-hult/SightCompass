# SightCompass
A simple android app to use as a sight compass. An ad free variant compared to the annoying ones on Play store.

Download. Create a new local android project from this folder. Then compile and install. :)

It does a similar job to https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.procop.mtools.compass&gl=US but much simpler. And Free.
